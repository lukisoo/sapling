# Welcome to Sapling!

This was a 48-hour hackathon project which placed 2nd at the DEVS x GDSC Hackathon 2023.

Sapling is a groundbreaking coworker matching application designed to enrich workplace environments and foster healthier, happier employees. Our platform cultivates a more connected, engaged, and productive workforce by encouraging workers to step outside for a break and bond over shared interests. But Sapling's reach extends beyond just professional contexts - it is a platform for everyone.

## Background
In our fast-paced digital world, work often takes a toll on us - even when working from the comforts of our homes. Here's where Sapling steps in. Our platform encourages users to pause, take a short break from work, and reconnect with the world outside their screens.

Sapling believes in the revitalizing power of nature and the outdoors. Amidst the ongoing work-from-home trend, it's easy to forget about the world beyond our home offices. We're here to change that. Sapling encourages users to step outside, breathe fresh air, and experience a refreshing change of scenery.

But that's not all! Sapling is also a social application designed to bring like-minded individuals together. You can meet and interact with others in a fun and friendly atmosphere in a workplace, university, or public group. It's about making connections, fostering friendships, and building a community while caring for your mental and physical well-being.

## Benefits

Sapling harnesses the power of social interactions and the refreshing ambience of the outdoors to promote a lifestyle that significantly enhances health and well-being. With each meeting organized through our platform, we foster physical activity, social interaction, and a connection to nature, all of which have proven benefits for overall health.

In an era where mental health and well-being are often neglected, Sapling is a solution that prioritizes your peace of mind. Our application reminds users to step back from work, breathe, and care for their mental well-being. Taking time for oneself and engaging in positive social interactions in a relaxing environment can significantly contribute to mental health.

Furthermore, Sapling understands the power of regular, healthy breaks. We enhance individual productivity and social capital by encouraging users to leave their work temporarily. Breaks are not just about rest; they're an opportunity to recharge, reconnect, and return to work with renewed energy and perspective.
